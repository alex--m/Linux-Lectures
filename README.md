# Linux-Lectures
Lectures about the Linux ecosystem for the public benefit 

## Syllabus
Here's a perliminary list of topics I think we want to cover:
1. *Introduction*: about Linux and FOSS
2. *Using the Shell*: accessing files and folders, pipes and redirection
3. *Processes*: creating an killing (background) processes, users and permissions
4. *File System*: standart tree structure, FS types, file permissions, mount
5. *Services*: boot sequence, services and service managers (e.g. systemd)
6. *Administration*: packages, distributions and system configuration
7. *User-space Programming*: File descriptors, syscalls, signals, (p)threads

Stuff I personally don't like teaching, but some courses ask me to:
- *Bash script*: variables, conditions, flow control and I/O
- *Vi*: using Vi(m), usually by demonstrating - and then running "vimtutor"

Stuff I think we should talk about:
- *Linux Kernel* - building, common sybsystems, kernel modules
- *Linux vs. other OSes* - when to use each one, pros and cons, 1337 linux usage examples
